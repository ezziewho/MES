# Finite Element Method (Metoda Elementów Skończonych)
A program that implements the Finite Element Method in C++
---
The Finite Element Method is a method of approximating solutions to partial differential equations. It involves dividing the subject of study into a grid composed of finite elements. Each element has nodes for which differential equations must be calculated. Here, the FEM has been applied to approximate thermal processes.
